# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favourably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `2`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The survey intends to gauge what voters want from a party and its leader during the final month of a federal election campaign. Specifically, the instrument measures voters’ evaluations of the party and its leader, gauges their importance on policy issues, their trust in the party and government, and their vote intentions, in effort to inform late-campaign messaging and the party's policy priorities.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
The target population is Canadian citizens eligible to vote in the upcoming federal election (exclude non‑citizens and those under age 18). In this case the sampling frame is the list of registered electors maintained by Elections Canada, with sampling units being individual voters on the list, with the observational units being those sampled voters who complete the survey.

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type: Stratified simple random sampling, given the ten provinces were divided into 27 geographic strata (14 major CMAs plus grouped smaller CMAs and non-CMA areas), with simple random samples drawn without replacement within each stratum. The survey also used "rejective sampling"—terminating interviews early for a portion of non-volunteers (0–50% by province) to allocate more effort toward finding the harder-to-reach volunteer population.

2. Sample size: Target was 20,000 respondents; actual was 16,149 (excluding rejected cases). Total households in scope: 47,436.

3. Target population: Persons aged 15 and older in Canada's ten provinces, excluding residents of the territories (Yukon, NWT, Nunavut) and full-time residents of institutions.

4. Sampling frame: Constructed from two sources: (1) lists of landline and cellular telephone numbers available to Statistics Canada, and (2) the Address Register of all dwellings in the ten provinces. About 86% of phone numbers were linked to addresses; the rest were included unlinked. Sampling units were groupings of phone numbers tied to the same address. Households without telephones were excluded from the frame but accounted for in weighting.

5. Survey mode(s): Two modes were offered—self-completed online questionnaire (rEQ) and computer-assisted telephone interview (iEQ). This was the first GSS cycle to offer online completion. Households with matched addresses received mailed invitations with a secure access code. About 52% of responses came via the online mode. Proxy interviews were not permitted.

6. Timeline: Data collection ran from September 4 to December 28, 2018. Most questions referenced the 12 months preceding the interview.

7. Response rate: 41.9% overall. Of 47,436 in-scope households, 49.9% were household-level non-response, 8.2% person-level non-response, 34.0% completed responses kept, and 7.8% were rejected under the rejective sampling protocol.

8. Weights: The person-level weight (WGHT_PER) adjusts for probability of selection, three-stage non-response, rejective sampling, and calibration to external population totals (stratum counts, 2017 Canadian Income Survey income distribution, and province-age-sex distributions). For variance estimation, 500 bootstrap replicate weights are provided.

9. Data processing: Responses were captured electronically in both modes. Write-in responses were coded using NAICS 2017 (industry), NOC 2016 (occupation), and ICNPO (non-profit organizations). Flow editing followed a top-down strategy, and derived variables were created. For the public-use file, donation values were perturbed and rounded to protect confidentiality.

10. Cleaning, imputation, etc.: Missing or off-path responses were coded as "Valid Skip" or "Not Stated." Donor imputation was used for item and partial non-response, matching recipients to similar donors via a score function. Imputation was done in nine steps covering income (about 18% imputed via tax linkage), volunteering hours, and donation variables (16.6% of donation totals came from imputed values).

11. Sources of error: Sampling error is addressed through bootstrap variance estimation, with CV thresholds guiding release (under 16.5% acceptable, 16.5–33.3% flagged, over 33.3% suppressed). Non-sampling errors include interviewer/respondent mistakes, data capture errors, non-response bias (mitigated by weight adjustments), and coverage error from excluding phoneless households.

12. Limitations, known biases, etc.: The 2018 cycle introduced online collection, making direct comparisons with prior iterations inappropriate per Statistics Canada. Other concerns include potential over/under-coverage from frame construction, mode effects between online and phone responses, and recall bias given the 12-month reference period.

13. Link to codebook (also in folder 02_activities/assignments/gss_codebook/2018_GSS33GVP_PUMFGuide.pdf): https://abacus.library.ubc.ca/api/access/datafile/95995
